    <h2><strong>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</strong></h2>
    <br>

    <p>Dear Eileen</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us the University os Awesome´s science faculty to study as part of your phD next year. I will answer your question one by one, in the following section. </p>

<h3>Starting dates</h3>

<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your stydy with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the star dates for each one are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 september 2016.</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017.</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

<p>Your can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our webside.</p>

<h3>Subjects of study</h3>

<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjest fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we´d like to have on our team. Saying that, of ideas you summitted we ere most intriged by are os followers, in order of priority:
</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub> H<sub>12</sub> 0<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceding 30º (86ªF), when the audience size exponentially encreases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li> HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjets, including how long you´d expect the research to take, requiered staff and othe resource, and anything else you think we´d need to know? Thanks.
    </p>

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate worl, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favorite dance are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>


    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little know but very influential dance dating as far as 300BS, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic Brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means fo getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involves hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around in imperceptable tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellows students used to say that he thought this dance inspires modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believe to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilled movements, being practices by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
